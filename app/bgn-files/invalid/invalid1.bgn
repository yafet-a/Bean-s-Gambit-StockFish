On a 4x4 board, the game begins,
Beans and cows, players take their spins,
Adjacent moves, not diagonally,
Strategy's key, to win the game brilliantly.

Beans move and take, cows one space stride,
Players strive, their pieces to hide,
End of the game, one cow can't move,
Victory's sealed, the opponent to soothe.

Bean's Gambit, a chess-like affair,
Intense moments, players beware,
Meticulous moves, each one counts,
Winning or losing, only the game amounts.
